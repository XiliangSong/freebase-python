#summary How to get freebase-python to work on Google AppEngine.

= Introduction =

Adding 3rd party libraries to Google AppEngine can be tricky, but don't worry, adding support for freebase-python is a breeze!


= Details =

In order to use the python freebase api in your Google AppEngine project, just issue the following command in the project's folder:
{{{
svn checkout http://freebase-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/freebase freebase
}}}
This will only install the actual code that runs the library, not all the egg business that usually comes with it. 

And that's it. No need to `easy_install` or `setup.py`, just {{{import freebase}}} and you're set.

If you want a working example, check out [http://freebase-images.appspot.com Freebase Images]. Its code is [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-python/source/browse/#svn/trunk/examples/freebase-images-appengine in the repository].
