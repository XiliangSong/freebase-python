freebase-python provides an easy way to acces [http://www.freebase.com/ freebase.com]'s API.

We'll be using one example query to demonstrate aspects of freebase-python.

{{{
query = {
    "name" : "The Beatles",
    "type" : "/music/artist",
    "album" : []
}
}}}

= A Simple Example =
Let's just make a simple read query for freebase:
{{{
import freebase
result = freebase.mqlread(query)
}}}

We could do the same for sandbox.freebase:
{{{
import freebase.sandbox
result = freebase.sandbox.mqlread(query)
}}}

For simplicity, you can call the class freebase and perform your operation. If you want to manage different connections with different settings, it is also possible to create HTTPMetawebSessions:
{{{
from freebase import HTTPMetawebSession
fms = HTTPMetawebSession("freebase.com")
sms = HTTPMetawebSession("sandbox.freebase.com")
result = fms.mqlread(query)
}}}
This would be useful if you wanted to be able to easily switch between using sandbox.freebase.com and freebase.com or if you wanted to create many sessions to execute in parallel.

= Base APIs =
A full list of the freebase apis is at the [http://www.freebase.com/view/freebase/metaweb_api_service metaweb_api_service page]. Most of them are supported here.

=== mqlread ===
{{{
r = freebase.mqlread(query)
}}}
`mqlread` is used to read information from freebase. The query must be written in MQL. For more information on MQL, refer to the [http://mql.freebaseapps.com/ MQL and Freebase API reference guide]. You can also test your queries on the [http://www.freebase.com/app/queryeditor/ Query Editor], which can provide additional information on the query if you're stuck.

=== mqlwrite ===
{{{
r = freebase.mqlwrite(query)
}}}
`mqlread`'s sister, `mqlwrite` writes to freebase. It's especially important to consult the [http://mql.freebaseapps.com/ reference guide], because writes are even more complicated than reads.

=== login ===
{{{
freebase.login(username=andrew, password=secret)
}}}
=== logout ===
{{{
freebase.logout()
}}}
=== loggedin ===
{{{
amiloggedin = freebase.loggedin()
}}}
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not a user is logged in or not.
=== user_info ===
{{{
r = freebase.user_info()
}}}
Returns a typical dictionary response with information on the user.
=== version ===
{{{
r = freebase.version()
}}}
Not usually needed, but it returns the current version of each of freebase's major systems.

= Service APIs =
Service APIs don't work any differently than the base APIs. There are five categories: `trans`, `upload`, `search`, `geosearch`, and `touch`.
